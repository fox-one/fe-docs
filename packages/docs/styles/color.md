# Colors

By default, the color of the control is mainly gray-scale color, and other colors are used as auxiliary colors of corresponding items. Each color matching is divided into two sets of color specifications: light (Light) and dark (Dark). They are used in the light theme (Light Mode)/dark theme (Dark Mode) in the interface design respectively.

## Greyscale

Grayscale colors are found in text colors and icon colors. The left column is the color scheme under the bright theme, and the right column is the color scheme under the dark theme.
